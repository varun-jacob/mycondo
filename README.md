## Installation

Install myCondo with npm.  Separate installation required for client and server side.

This project was built using node, react, express, knex, mySQL and you will need to install these applications and/or dependencies.


```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```

```bash
  cd server
  npm install
```

For the server, a database needs to be created in mySQL called myCondo.  After you need to run knex migrate:latest
    
## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Code early on.  Tutorials can take a lot of time and may not be in line with tech stack you are using.
- Understand basics of Figma to create mock-ups.  This helps separate components, which can reduce the amount of time spent refactoring code for components and styling
- File and Calendar libraries were difficult to implement given other new concepts applied
- Believe in your ability to learn. I learned or applied the following concepts for the first time:
    - Built a database using Knex, MySQL
    - Structured back end using Module View Controller (MVC)
    - Used React Hooks to set states
    - Built a full CRUD application
